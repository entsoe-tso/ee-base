### Getting started

Styled components and elements are managed in a base.css stylesheet. To use base on any ENTSO-E site, link directly to the source file by adding this line before the closing `</head>` in your HTML document:

```html
 <link href='https://docs.entsoe.eu/ee-base/latest/styles/main.css' rel='stylesheet' />
```

### Rule of thumb
Read the styleguide or the base.css document before making positioning or typographic adjustments. If base is missing a particular style you need, make a case for it in the repository.

### Code style

- Two space, soft tab indentation

- Put spaces before `{` in rule declarations.

- Use hex color codes #000 unless using rgba. If you use an rgba rule, include a fallback. i.e:

```css
.illustration {
  background-color: #eee; /* Fallback */
  background-color: rgba(221, 221, 221, 0.75);
}
```

- Site specific styling should be added to a site.css document and not contained as inline rules in your HTML document
